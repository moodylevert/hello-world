an introduction into an unavoidable abyss
so  i guess its been fated for us to meet this way, playing hide and seek in binary fashion. All i'm worried about is how far can the creative envelope be pushed in this second and a half childhood i'm experiencing. My name is Ritchi, but my friends like to call me moody; i'd like to believe that i'm pretty tolerant of mine and others' emotional states. I am trying to become a webGl master one of these days. But until then i'll focus on the basics down.
